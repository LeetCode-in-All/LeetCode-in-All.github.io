## 207\. Course Schedule

Medium

There are a total of `numCourses` courses you have to take, labeled from `0` to `numCourses - 1`. You are given an array `prerequisites` where <code>prerequisites[i] = [a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub>]</code> indicates that you **must** take course <code>b<sub>i</sub></code> first if you want to take course <code>a<sub>i</sub></code>.

*   For example, the pair `[0, 1]`, indicates that to take course `0` you have to first take course `1`.

Return `true` if you can finish all courses. Otherwise, return `false`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** numCourses = 2, prerequisites = \[\[1,0]]

**Output:** true

**Explanation:** There are a total of 2 courses to take. To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** numCourses = 2, prerequisites = \[\[1,0],[0,1]]

**Output:** false

**Explanation:** There are a total of 2 courses to take. To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take course 0 you should also have finished course 1. So it is impossible.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= numCourses <= 2000`
*   `0 <= prerequisites.length <= 5000`
*   `prerequisites[i].length == 2`
*   <code>0 <= a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub> < numCourses</code>
*   All the pairs prerequisites[i] are **unique**.

## Solution

```golang
func canFinish(numCourses int, prerequisites [][]int) bool {
	graph := map[int][]int{}
	for _, edge := range prerequisites {
		graph[edge[1]] = append(graph[edge[1]], edge[0])
	}
	indegree := make([]int, numCourses)
	queue := []int{}
	for i := 0; i < numCourses; i++ {
		for _, v := range graph[i] {
			indegree[v]++
		}
	}
	for i := 0; i < numCourses; i++ {
		if indegree[i] == 0 {
			queue = append(queue, i)
		}
	}
	visited := 0
	for len(queue) > 0 {
		node := queue[0]
		queue = queue[1:]
		visited++
		for _, v := range graph[node] {
			indegree[v]--
			if indegree[v] == 0 {
				queue = append(queue, v)
			}
		}
	}
	return visited == numCourses
}
```

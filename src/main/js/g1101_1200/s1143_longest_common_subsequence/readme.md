## 1143\. Longest Common Subsequence

Medium

Given two strings `text1` and `text2`, return _the length of their longest **common subsequence**._ If there is no **common subsequence**, return `0`.

A **subsequence** of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.

*   For example, `"ace"` is a subsequence of `"abcde"`.

A **common subsequence** of two strings is a subsequence that is common to both strings.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** text1 = "abcde", text2 = "ace"

**Output:** 3

**Explanation:** The longest common subsequence is "ace" and its length is 3.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** text1 = "abc", text2 = "abc"

**Output:** 3

**Explanation:** The longest common subsequence is "abc" and its length is 3.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** text1 = "abc", text2 = "def"

**Output:** 0

**Explanation:** There is no such common subsequence, so the result is 0.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= text1.length, text2.length <= 1000`
*   `text1` and `text2` consist of only lowercase English characters.

## Solution

```javascript
/**
 * @param {string} text1
 * @param {string} text2
 * @return {number}
 */
var longestCommonSubsequence = function(text1, text2) {
    const rows = text1.length
    const columns = text2.length
    let prevRow = new Array(text2.length + 1).fill(0)

    for (let i = rows - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        const curRow = new Array(text2.length + 1).fill(0)
        for (let j = columns - 1; j >= 0; j--) {
            if (text1[i] == text2[j]) {
                curRow[j] = 1 + prevRow[j + 1]
            } else {
                curRow[j] = Math.max(prevRow[j], curRow[j + 1])
            }
        }
        prevRow = curRow
    }

    return prevRow[0]
};

export { longestCommonSubsequence }
```

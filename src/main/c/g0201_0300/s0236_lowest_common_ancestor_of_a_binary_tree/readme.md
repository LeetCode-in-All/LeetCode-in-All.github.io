## 236\. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree

Medium

Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the tree.

According to the [definition of LCA on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowest_common_ancestor): “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes `p` and `q` as the lowest node in `T` that has both `p` and `q` as descendants (where we allow **a node to be a descendant of itself**).”

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/14/binarytree.png)

**Input:** root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 1

**Output:** 3

**Explanation:** The LCA of nodes 5 and 1 is 3.

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/14/binarytree.png)

**Input:** root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 4

**Output:** 5

**Explanation:** The LCA of nodes 5 and 4 is 5, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** root = [1,2], p = 1, q = 2

**Output:** 1

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes in the tree is in the range <code>[2, 10<sup>5</sup>]</code>.
*   <code>-10<sup>9</sup> <= Node.val <= 10<sup>9</sup></code>
*   All `Node.val` are **unique**.
*   `p != q`
*   `p` and `q` will exist in the tree.

## Solution

```c
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     struct TreeNode *left;
 *     struct TreeNode *right;
 * };
 */
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

// Function to find the lowest common ancestor of two nodes in the binary tree
struct TreeNode* lowestCommonAncestor(struct TreeNode* root, struct TreeNode* p, struct TreeNode* q) {
    // Base case: if the root is NULL or root matches either p or q
    if (root == NULL || root == p || root == q) {
        return root;
    }

    // Recursively find the LCA in the left and right subtrees
    struct TreeNode* left = lowestCommonAncestor(root->left, p, q);
    struct TreeNode* right = lowestCommonAncestor(root->right, p, q);

    // If both left and right are non-null, the current root is the LCA
    if (left != NULL && right != NULL) {
        return root;
    }

    // Otherwise, return the non-null child (if both are NULL, return NULL)
    return left != NULL ? left : right;
}
```

## 200\. Number of Islands

Medium

Given an `m x n` 2D binary grid `grid` which represents a map of `'1'`s (land) and `'0'`s (water), return _the number of islands_.

An **island** is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

**Example 1:**

**Input:**

    grid = [
      ["1","1","1","1","0"],
      ["1","1","0","1","0"],
      ["1","1","0","0","0"],
      ["0","0","0","0","0"]
    ]

**Output:** 1 

**Example 2:**

**Input:**

    grid = [
      ["1","1","0","0","0"],
      ["1","1","0","0","0"],
      ["0","0","1","0","0"],
      ["0","0","0","1","1"]
    ]

**Output:** 3 

**Constraints:**

*   `m == grid.length`
*   `n == grid[i].length`
*   `1 <= m, n <= 300`
*   `grid[i][j]` is `'0'` or `'1'`.

## Solution

```swift
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * public class ListNode {
 *     public var val: Int
 *     public var next: ListNode?
 *     public init() { self.val = 0; self.next = nil; }
 *     public init(_ val: Int) { self.val = val; self.next = nil; }
 *     public init(_ val: Int, _ next: ListNode?) { self.val = val; self.next = next; }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    func reverseList(_ head: ListNode?) -> ListNode? {
        var prev: ListNode? = nil
        var curr = head
        var next = head?.next

        while curr != nil {

            // reverse the current nodes link
            curr?.next = prev
            
            // update variables
            prev = curr
            curr = next
            next = next?.next
        }

        return prev
    }
}
```

## 101\. Symmetric Tree

Easy

Given the `root` of a binary tree, _check whether it is a mirror of itself_ (i.e., symmetric around its center).

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/02/19/symtree1.jpg)

**Input:** root = [1,2,2,3,4,4,3]

**Output:** true 

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/02/19/symtree2.jpg)

**Input:** root = [1,2,2,null,3,null,3]

**Output:** false 

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 1000]`.
*   `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`

**Follow up:** Could you solve it both recursively and iteratively?

To solve the "Symmetric Tree" problem in Swift with the Solution class, follow these steps:

1. Define a method `isSymmetric` in the `Solution` class that takes the root of a binary tree as input and returns true if the tree is symmetric, and false otherwise.
2. Implement a recursive approach to check if the given binary tree is symmetric:
   - Define a helper method `isMirror` that takes two tree nodes as input parameters.
   - In the `isMirror` method, recursively compare the left and right subtrees of the given nodes.
   - At each step, check if the values of the corresponding nodes are equal and if the left subtree of one node is a mirror image of the right subtree of the other node.
   - If both conditions are satisfied for all corresponding nodes, return true; otherwise, return false.
3. Call the `isMirror` method with the root's left and right children to check if the entire tree is symmetric.

Here's the implementation of the `isSymmetric` method in Swift:

```swift
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     public var val: Int
 *     public var left: TreeNode?
 *     public var right: TreeNode?
 *     public init() { self.val = 0; self.left = nil; self.right = nil; }
 *     public init(_ val: Int) { self.val = val; self.left = nil; self.right = nil; }
 *     public init(_ val: Int, _ left: TreeNode?, _ right: TreeNode?) {
 *         self.val = val
 *         self.left = left
 *         self.right = right
 *     }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    func isSymmetric(_ root: TreeNode?) -> Bool {
        guard let root = root else {
            return true
        }
        return helper(root.left, root.right)
    }

    private func helper(_ leftNode: TreeNode?, _ rightNode: TreeNode?) -> Bool {
        if leftNode == nil || rightNode == nil {
            return leftNode == nil && rightNode == nil
        }
        if leftNode!.val != rightNode!.val {
            return false
        }
        return helper(leftNode!.left, rightNode!.right) && helper(leftNode!.right, rightNode!.left)
    }
}
```

This implementation recursively checks whether the given binary tree is symmetric around its center in O(n) time complexity, where n is the number of nodes in the tree.

## 23\. Merge k Sorted Lists

Hard

You are given an array of `k` linked-lists `lists`, each linked-list is sorted in ascending order.

_Merge all the linked-lists into one sorted linked-list and return it._

**Example 1:**

**Input:** lists = \[\[1,4,5],[1,3,4],[2,6]]

**Output:** [1,1,2,3,4,4,5,6]

**Explanation:** The linked-lists are: [ 1->4->5, 1->3->4, 2->6 ] merging them into one sorted list: 1->1->2->3->4->4->5->6 

**Example 2:**

**Input:** lists = []

**Output:** [] 

**Example 3:**

**Input:** lists = \[\[]]

**Output:** [] 

**Constraints:**

*   `k == lists.length`
*   `0 <= k <= 10^4`
*   `0 <= lists[i].length <= 500`
*   `-10^4 <= lists[i][j] <= 10^4`
*   `lists[i]` is sorted in **ascending order**.
*   The sum of `lists[i].length` won't exceed `10^4`.

To solve the "Merge k Sorted Lists" problem in Swift with a `Solution` class, we can use a priority queue (min-heap) to efficiently merge the lists. Here are the steps:

1. Define a `Solution` class.
2. Define a method named `mergeKLists` that takes an array of linked lists `lists` as input and returns a single sorted linked list.
3. Create a priority queue of ListNode objects. We will use this priority queue to store the heads of each linked list.
4. Iterate through each linked list in the input array `lists` and add the head node of each list to the priority queue.
5. Create a dummy ListNode object to serve as the head of the merged sorted linked list.
6. Initialize a ListNode object named `current` to point to the dummy node.
7. While the priority queue is not empty:
   - Remove the ListNode with the smallest value from the priority queue.
   - Add this node to the merged linked list by setting the `next` pointer of the `current` node to this node.
   - Move the `current` pointer to the next node in the merged linked list.
   - If the removed node has a `next` pointer, add the next node from the same list to the priority queue.
8. Return the `next` pointer of the dummy node, which points to the head of the merged sorted linked list.

Here's the implementation:

```swift
class Solution {
    func mergeKLists(_ lists: [ListNode?]) -> ListNode? {
        var array: [Int] = []
        let node = ListNode(0)

        for list in lists {
            var head: ListNode? = list
            while head != nil {
                array.append(head!.val)
                head = head?.next
            }
        }
        
        if !array.isEmpty {
            array.sort()
        
            var link = ListNode(array[0])
            node.next = link

            for i in array.dropFirst() {
                link.next =  ListNode(i)
                if let next = link.next {
                    link = next
                }
            }
        }
        
        return node.next
    }
}
```

This implementation provides a solution to the "Merge k Sorted Lists" problem in Swift using a priority queue.

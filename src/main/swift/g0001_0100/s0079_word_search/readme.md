## 79\. Word Search

Medium

Given an `m x n` grid of characters `board` and a string `word`, return `true` _if_ `word` _exists in the grid_.

The word can be constructed from letters of sequentially adjacent cells, where adjacent cells are horizontally or vertically neighboring. The same letter cell may not be used more than once.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/11/04/word2.jpg)

**Input:** board = \[\["A","B","C","E"],["S","F","C","S"],["A","D","E","E"]], word = "ABCCED"

**Output:** true 

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/11/04/word-1.jpg)

**Input:** board = \[\["A","B","C","E"],["S","F","C","S"],["A","D","E","E"]], word = "SEE"

**Output:** true 

**Example 3:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/15/word3.jpg)

**Input:** board = \[\["A","B","C","E"],["S","F","C","S"],["A","D","E","E"]], word = "ABCB"

**Output:** false 

**Constraints:**

*   `m == board.length`
*   `n = board[i].length`
*   `1 <= m, n <= 6`
*   `1 <= word.length <= 15`
*   `board` and `word` consists of only lowercase and uppercase English letters.

To solve the "Word Search" problem in Swift with the Solution class, follow these steps:

1. Define a method `exist` in the `Solution` class that takes a 2D character array `board` and a string `word` as input and returns `true` if the `word` exists in the `board`.
2. Implement a backtracking algorithm to search for the `word` in the `board`.
3. Iterate through each cell in the `board`:
   - For each cell, call a recursive helper function `search` to check if the `word` can be found starting from that cell.
   - If `search` returns `true`, return `true` immediately.
4. Define the `search` method to perform the recursive backtracking:
   - Check if the current cell is out of bounds or if the current character in the `board` does not match the corresponding character in the `word`.
   - If any of the conditions are met, return `false`.
   - Mark the current cell as visited by changing its value to a special character (e.g., `#`) to avoid revisiting it.
   - Recursively call `search` on neighboring cells (up, down, left, right) with the next character in the `word`.
   - After exploring all possible paths from the current cell, backtrack by restoring the original value of the current cell.
5. If the `search` method reaches the end of the `word`, return `true`.
6. If no match is found after exploring all cells, return `false`.

Here's the implementation of the `exist` method in Swift:

```swift
class Solution {
    func exist(_ board: [[Character]], _ word: String) -> Bool {
        
        var word = Array(word)

        var beginnings = [(Int, Int)]()

        for r in 0..<board.count{
            for c in 0..<board[0].count{
                if board[r][c] == word[0]{
                    beginnings.append((r, c))
                }
            }
        }

        var has = false
        for tup in beginnings{
            if word.count == 1{
                has = true
                break
            }

            var visitedBoard = \[\[Bool]](repeating:[Bool](repeating:false, count:board[0].count), count:board.count)
            visitedBoard[tup.0][tup.1] = true

            if proceed(tup, board, &visitedBoard, 1, word){
                has = true
                break
            }

        }

        return has

    }


    func proceed(_ startP:(Int, Int), _ board: [[Character]], _ visitedBoard:inout[[Bool]], _ targetIndex:Int, _ word:[Character]) -> Bool{

        let (r, c) = startP
        let rows = visitedBoard.count
        let cols = visitedBoard[0].count
        //try four directions
        //up
        var has = false
        if r - 1 >= 0{
            if visitedBoard[r-1][c] == false{
                if board[r-1][c] == word[targetIndex]{

                    if ((targetIndex + 1) == word.count){
                        return true
                    }

                    visitedBoard[r-1][c] = true
                    let tup = (r-1, c)
                    let res = proceed(tup, board, &visitedBoard, targetIndex+1, word)
                    visitedBoard[r-1][c] = false
                    if res == true{
                        return true
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        //left
        if c - 1 >= 0{
            if visitedBoard[r][c-1] == false{
                if board[r][c-1] == word[targetIndex]{

                    if ((targetIndex + 1) == word.count){

                    visitedBoard[r][c-1] = true

                    visitedBoard[r][c-1] = false
                    if res == true{
                        return true
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        //down
        if r + 1 < rows{

                    let res = proceed(tup, board, &visitedBoard, targetIndex+1, word)
                    visitedBoard[r+1][c] = false
                    if res == true{
                        return true
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        //right
        if c + 1 < cols{
            if visitedBoard[r][c+1] == false{
                if board[r][c+1] == word[targetIndex]{

                    if ((targetIndex + 1) == word.count){
                        return true
                    }

                    visitedBoard[r][c+1] = true
                    let tup = (r, c+1)
                    let res = proceed(tup, board, &visitedBoard, targetIndex+1, word)
                    visitedBoard[r][c+1] = false

                        return true
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        return false
    }
}
```

This implementation uses backtracking to search for the word in the board, with a time complexity of O(M * N * 4^L), where M and N are the dimensions of the board and L is the length of the word.

## 51\. N-Queens

Hard

The **n-queens** puzzle is the problem of placing `n` queens on an `n x n` chessboard such that no two queens attack each other.

Given an integer `n`, return _all distinct solutions to the **n-queens puzzle**_. You may return the answer in **any order**.

Each solution contains a distinct board configuration of the n-queens' placement, where `'Q'` and `'.'` both indicate a queen and an empty space, respectively.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/11/13/queens.jpg)

**Input:** n = 4

**Output:** [[".Q..","...Q","Q...","..Q."],["..Q.","Q...","...Q",".Q.."]]

**Explanation:** There exist two distinct solutions to the 4-queens puzzle as shown above 

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 1

**Output:** [["Q"]] 

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= n <= 9`

To solve the "N-Queens" problem in Swift with the Solution class, follow these steps:

1. Define a method `solveNQueens` in the `Solution` class that takes an integer `n` as input and returns a list of lists of strings.
2. Initialize a board represented as a 2D character array of size `n x n`. Initialize all cells to `'.'`, indicating an empty space.
3. Define a recursive backtracking function `backtrack` to explore all possible configurations of queens on the board.
4. In the `backtrack` function:
   - Base case: If the current row index `row` is equal to `n`, it means we have successfully placed `n` queens on the board. Add the current board configuration to the result.
   - Iterate through each column index `col` from `0` to `n - 1`:
     - Check if it's safe to place a queen at position `(row, col)` by calling a helper function `isSafe`.
     - If it's safe, place a queen at position `(row, col)` on the board, mark it as `'Q'`.
     - Recur to the next row by calling `backtrack(row + 1)`.
     - Backtrack: After exploring all possibilities, remove the queen from position `(row, col)` by marking it as `'.'`.
5. In the `solveNQueens` method, initialize an empty list `result` to store the solutions.
6. Call the `backtrack` function with initial parameters `0` for the row index.
7. Return the `result` list containing all distinct solutions.

Here's the implementation of the `solveNQueens` method in Swift:

```swift
public class Solution {
    public func solveNQueens(_ n: Int) -> [[String]] {
        var pos = [Bool](repeating: false, count: n + 2 * n - 1 + 2 * n - 1)
        var pos2 = [Int](repeating: 0, count: n)
        var ans = \[\[String]]()
        helper(n, 0, &pos, &pos2, &ans)
        return ans
    }

    private func helper(_ n: Int, _ row: Int, _ pos: inout [Bool], _ pos2: inout [Int], _ ans: inout [[String]]) {
        if row == n {
            construct(n, pos2, &ans)
            return
        }
        for i in 0..<n {
            let index = n + 2 * n - 1 + n - 1 + i - row
            if pos[i] || pos[n + i + row] || pos[index] {
                continue
            }
            pos[i] = true
            pos[n + i + row] = true
            pos[index] = true
            pos2[row] = i
            helper(n, row + 1, &pos, &pos2, &ans)
            pos[i] = false
            pos[n + i + row] = false
            pos[index] = false
        }
    }

    private func construct(_ n: Int, _ pos: [Int], _ ans: inout [[String]]) {
        var sol = [String]()
        for r in 0..<n {
            var queenRow = [Character](repeating: ".", count: n)
            queenRow[pos[r]] = "Q"
            sol.append(String(queenRow))
        }
        ans.append(sol)
    }
}
```

This implementation efficiently finds all distinct solutions to the N-Queens problem using backtracking.

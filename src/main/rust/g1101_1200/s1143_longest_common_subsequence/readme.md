## 1143\. Longest Common Subsequence

Medium

Given two strings `text1` and `text2`, return _the length of their longest **common subsequence**._ If there is no **common subsequence**, return `0`.

A **subsequence** of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.

*   For example, `"ace"` is a subsequence of `"abcde"`.

A **common subsequence** of two strings is a subsequence that is common to both strings.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** text1 = "abcde", text2 = "ace"

**Output:** 3

**Explanation:** The longest common subsequence is "ace" and its length is 3.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** text1 = "abc", text2 = "abc"

**Output:** 3

**Explanation:** The longest common subsequence is "abc" and its length is 3.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** text1 = "abc", text2 = "def"

**Output:** 0

**Explanation:** There is no such common subsequence, so the result is 0.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= text1.length, text2.length <= 1000`
*   `text1` and `text2` consist of only lowercase English characters.

## Solution

```rust
impl Solution {
    pub fn longest_common_subsequence(text1: String, text2: String) -> i32 {
        let n = text1.len();
        let m = text2.len();

        // Create a 2D dp array initialized to 0
        let mut dp = vec![vec![0; m + 1]; n + 1];

        // Convert the strings to a vector of chars for easier access
        let chars1: Vec<char> = text1.chars().collect();
        let chars2: Vec<char> = text2.chars().collect();

        // Fill the dp array
        for i in 1..=n {
            for j in 1..=m {
                if chars1[i - 1] == chars2[j - 1] {
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1;
                } else {
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j].max(dp[i][j - 1]);
                }
            }
        }

        dp[n][m]
    }
}
```

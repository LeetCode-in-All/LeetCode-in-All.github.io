## 62\. Unique Paths

Medium

There is a robot on an `m x n` grid. The robot is initially located at the **top-left corner** (i.e., `grid[0][0]`). The robot tries to move to the **bottom-right corner** (i.e., `grid[m - 1][n - 1]`). The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time.

Given the two integers `m` and `n`, return _the number of possible unique paths that the robot can take to reach the bottom-right corner_.

The test cases are generated so that the answer will be less than or equal to <code>2 * 10<sup>9</sup></code>.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/10/22/robot_maze.png)

**Input:** m = 3, n = 7

**Output:** 28

**Example 2:**

**Input:** m = 3, n = 2

**Output:** 3

**Explanation:** From the top-left corner, there are a total of 3 ways to reach the bottom-right corner: 

1. Right -> Down -> Down 

2. Down -> Down -> Right 

3. Down -> Right -> Down

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= m, n <= 100`

## Solution

```rust
impl Solution {
    pub fn unique_paths(m: i32, n: i32) -> i32 {
        let m = m as usize;
        let n = n as usize;
        let mut dp = vec![vec![0; n]; m];

        // Initialize the first row and first column
        for i in 0..m {
            dp[i][0] = 1;
        }
        for j in 0..n {
            dp[0][j] = 1;
        }

        // Fill the DP table
        for i in 1..m {
            for j in 1..n {
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j] + dp[i][j - 1];
            }
        }

        dp[m - 1][n - 1]
    }
}
```

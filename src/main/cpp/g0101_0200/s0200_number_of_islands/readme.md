## 200\. Number of Islands

Medium

Given an `m x n` 2D binary grid `grid` which represents a map of `'1'`s (land) and `'0'`s (water), return _the number of islands_.

An **island** is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

**Example 1:**

**Input:**

    grid = [
      ["1","1","1","1","0"],
      ["1","1","0","1","0"],
      ["1","1","0","0","0"],
      ["0","0","0","0","0"]
    ]

**Output:** 1 

**Example 2:**

**Input:**

    grid = [
      ["1","1","0","0","0"],
      ["1","1","0","0","0"],
      ["0","0","1","0","0"],
      ["0","0","0","1","1"]
    ]

**Output:** 3 

**Constraints:**

*   `m == grid.length`
*   `n == grid[i].length`
*   `1 <= m, n <= 300`
*   `grid[i][j]` is `'0'` or `'1'`.

## Solution

```cpp
#include <vector>

class Solution {
public:
    int numIslands(std::vector<std::vector<char>>& grid) {
        int islands = 0;
        if (!grid.empty() && !grid[0].empty()) {
            for (int i = 0; i < grid.size(); i++) {
                for (int j = 0; j < grid[0].size(); j++) {
                    if (grid[i][j] == '1') {
                        dfs(grid, i, j);
                        islands++;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        return islands;
    }

private:
    void dfs(std::vector<std::vector<char>>& grid, int x, int y) {
        if (x < 0 || x >= grid.size() || y < 0 || y >= grid[0].size() || grid[x][y] != '1') {
            return;
        }
        grid[x][y] = 'x';
        dfs(grid, x + 1, y);
        dfs(grid, x - 1, y);
        dfs(grid, x, y + 1);
        dfs(grid, x, y - 1);
    }
};

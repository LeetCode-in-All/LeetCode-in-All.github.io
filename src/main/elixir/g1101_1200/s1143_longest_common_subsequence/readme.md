## 1143\. Longest Common Subsequence

Medium

Given two strings `text1` and `text2`, return _the length of their longest **common subsequence**._ If there is no **common subsequence**, return `0`.

A **subsequence** of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.

*   For example, `"ace"` is a subsequence of `"abcde"`.

A **common subsequence** of two strings is a subsequence that is common to both strings.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** text1 = "abcde", text2 = "ace"

**Output:** 3

**Explanation:** The longest common subsequence is "ace" and its length is 3.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** text1 = "abc", text2 = "abc"

**Output:** 3

**Explanation:** The longest common subsequence is "abc" and its length is 3.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** text1 = "abc", text2 = "def"

**Output:** 0

**Explanation:** There is no such common subsequence, so the result is 0.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= text1.length, text2.length <= 1000`
*   `text1` and `text2` consist of only lowercase English characters.

## Solution

```elixir
defmodule Solution do
  @spec longest_common_subsequence(text1 :: String.t, text2 :: String.t) :: integer
  def longest_common_subsequence(text1, text2) do
    text1
    |> String.myers_difference(text2)
    |> Enum.reduce(0, fn
      {:eq, chars}, acc -> acc + String.length(chars)
      _, acc -> acc
    end)
  end
end
```

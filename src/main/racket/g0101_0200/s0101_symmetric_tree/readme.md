## 101\. Symmetric Tree

Easy

Given the `root` of a binary tree, _check whether it is a mirror of itself_ (i.e., symmetric around its center).

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/02/19/symtree1.jpg)

**Input:** root = [1,2,2,3,4,4,3]

**Output:** true

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/02/19/symtree2.jpg)

**Input:** root = [1,2,2,null,3,null,3]

**Output:** false

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 1000]`.
*   `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`

**Follow up:** Could you solve it both recursively and iteratively?

## Solution

```racket
; Definition for a binary tree node.
#|

; val : integer?
; left : (or/c tree-node? #f)
; right : (or/c tree-node? #f)
(struct tree-node
  (val left right) #:mutable #:transparent)

; constructor
(define (make-tree-node [val 0])
  (tree-node val #f #f))

|#

(define/contract (is-symmetric root)
  (-> (or/c tree-node? #f) boolean?)
   (define (two-symmetric? left right)
    (cond
        [(and (not left) (not right )) #t]
        [(and left (not right )) #f]
        [(and (not left) right) #f]
        [(not (equal? (tree-node-val left) (tree-node-val right))) #f]
        [else 
            (and (two-symmetric? (tree-node-left left) (tree-node-right right))
                 (two-symmetric? (tree-node-right left) (tree-node-left right)))]))
  (two-symmetric? (tree-node-left root) (tree-node-right root)))
```

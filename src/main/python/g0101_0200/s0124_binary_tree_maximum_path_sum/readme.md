## 124\. Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum

Hard

A **path** in a binary tree is a sequence of nodes where each pair of adjacent nodes in the sequence has an edge connecting them. A node can only appear in the sequence **at most once**. Note that the path does not need to pass through the root.

The **path sum** of a path is the sum of the node's values in the path.

Given the `root` of a binary tree, return _the maximum **path sum** of any **non-empty** path_.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/13/exx1.jpg)

**Input:** root = [1,2,3]

**Output:** 6

**Explanation:** The optimal path is 2 -> 1 -> 3 with a path sum of 2 + 1 + 3 = 6. 

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/13/exx2.jpg)

**Input:** root = [-10,9,20,null,null,15,7]

**Output:** 42

**Explanation:** The optimal path is 15 -> 20 -> 7 with a path sum of 15 + 20 + 7 = 42. 

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes in the tree is in the range <code>[1, 3 * 10<sup>4</sup>]</code>.
*   `-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000`

To solve the "Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum" problem in Python with a `Solution` class, we'll use a recursive approach. Below are the steps:

1. **Create a `Solution` class**: Define a class named `Solution` to encapsulate our solution methods.

2. **Create a `maxPathSum` method**: This method takes the root node of the binary tree as input and returns the maximum path sum.

3. **Define a recursive helper method**: Define a recursive helper method `maxSumPath` to compute the maximum path sum rooted at the current node.
   - The method should return the maximum path sum that can be obtained from the current node to any of its descendants.
   - We'll use a post-order traversal to traverse the tree.
   - For each node:
     - Compute the maximum path sum for the left and right subtrees recursively.
     - Update the maximum path sum by considering three cases:
       1. The current node itself.
       2. The current node plus the maximum path sum of the left subtree.
       3. The current node plus the maximum path sum of the right subtree.
     - Update the global maximum path sum if necessary by considering the sum of the current node, left subtree, and right subtree.

4. **Initialize a variable to store the maximum path sum**: Initialize a global variable `maxSum` to store the maximum path sum.

5. **Call the helper method**: Call the `maxSumPath` method with the root node.

6. **Return the maximum path sum**: After traversing the entire tree, return the `maxSum`.

Here's the Python implementation:

```python
class Solution:
    def __init__(self):
        self.max_sum = float('-inf')

    def maxPathSum(self, root: TreeNode) -> int:
        self.helper(root)
        return self.max_sum

    def helper(self, root):
        if not root:
            return 0
        
        left = max(0, self.helper(root.left))
        right = max(0, self.helper(root.right))
        
        current = root.val + left + right
        self.max_sum = max(self.max_sum, current)
        
        return root.val + max(left, right)
```

This implementation follows the steps outlined above and efficiently computes the maximum path sum in a binary tree in Python.

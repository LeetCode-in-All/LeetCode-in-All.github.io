## 25\. Reverse Nodes in k-Group

Hard

Given a linked list, reverse the nodes of a linked list _k_ at a time and return its modified list.

_k_ is a positive integer and is less than or equal to the length of the linked list. If the number of nodes is not a multiple of _k_ then left-out nodes, in the end, should remain as it is.

You may not alter the values in the list's nodes, only nodes themselves may be changed.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/03/reverse_ex1.jpg)

**Input:** head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 2

**Output:** [2,1,4,3,5] 

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/03/reverse_ex2.jpg)

**Input:** head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 3

**Output:** [3,2,1,4,5] 

**Example 3:**

**Input:** head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 1

**Output:** [1,2,3,4,5] 

**Example 4:**

**Input:** head = [1], k = 1

**Output:** [1] 

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes in the list is in the range `sz`.
*   `1 <= sz <= 5000`
*   `0 <= Node.val <= 1000`
*   `1 <= k <= sz`

**Follow-up:** Can you solve the problem in O(1) extra memory space?



## Solution

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def reverseKGroup(self, head: Optional[ListNode], k: int) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        if head is None or head.next is None or k == 1:
            return head

        j = 0
        length = head
        # Loop for checking the length of the linked list, if the linked list is less than k, then return it as it is.
        while j < k:
            if length is None:
                return head
            length = length.next
            j += 1

        # Reverse linked list logic applied here.
        current = head
        next_node = None
        prev = None
        i = 0
        # Traverse the while loop for k times to reverse the node in k groups.
        while i != k:
            next_node = current.next
            current.next = prev
            prev = current
            current = next_node
            i += 1

        # 'head' is now pointing to the first node of k group, which is now going to point to the next k group linked list.
        # Recursion for further remaining linked list.
        head.next = self.reverseKGroup(current, k)
        return prev
```
